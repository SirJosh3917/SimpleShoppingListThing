# What is this?
This is my beginner attempt at WPF & EFCore

### wow your code stinx
yes i agree, and most of it is because i'm lazy
some notable things:
  - hashing the password in multiple places, hoping that they hash it by the username instead of making this explicit
  - WPF form designer code just sucks
  - redundant code
  - i suck at design
  - dear god frontend is HELL
  - :pray: for you frontend devs
  - i'm gonna go back to backend development and never touch the frontend again
